            <h1>HTML & CSS Cheat Sheet</h1>
            <p>A breif overview of semantic html elements and how to use them.</p>
            
            <h2>Why care about semantic html?</h2>
            <p>A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.<br> Non-semantic html, like &lt;div&gt; & &lt;span&gt;, is easy to use, but difficult for other developers to understand and pick up quickly.<br> This can present unseen challenges in the future.<br> In addition to benefiting other developers, semantic html will also benefit you when you come back to and revamp/refactor your own code. </p>
